# Complex Vector and Matrix Operations with NumPy

This repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks exploring advanced operations with complex numbers, vector spaces, and matrices, including Hermitian, Unitary, and Tensor matrices.

## Notebooks

1. **Complex Vector Matrix Operations with NumPy** (`Complex_Vector_Matrix_Operations_with_NumPy.ipynb`):
   - Focuses on complex vector and matrix manipulations using the NumPy library in Python.
   - Includes operations such as eigenvalue decomposition and matrix multiplication for complex numbers.

2. **Introduction to Complex Numbers** (`ComplexIntro.ipynb`):
   - Provides a basic introduction to complex numbers, their properties, and how they can be implemented and manipulated in Python.
   - Explores arithmetic operations, polar forms, and graphical representations of complex numbers.

3. **Hermitian, Unitary, and Tensor Operations** (`TallerEsp.Vect-Hermitian-Unitary-Tensor-Circuits.ipynb`):
   - Explores advanced concepts such as Hermitian and Unitary matrices.
   - Demonstrates how tensor products can be computed and applied in quantum circuits.

4. **Internal Product, Eigen Values, Eigen Vectors** (`Internal_Product_Eigen_Values_Eigen_Vectors.ipynb`):
   - A comprehensive tutorial on complex internal products with a focus on quantum computing applications.
   - Covers how to compute complex internal products for both column vectors and square matrices.
   - Includes Python implementations for eigenvalue and eigenvector computations as well as matrix transformations.

   ### Key Topics:
